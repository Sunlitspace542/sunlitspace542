I'm that plural dork on the internet that brings you such things as continued updates for Star Fox EX and progress updates on Star Fox CD.  
Along with Monika, we together form Emerald Softworks.  

I'm a ROMhacker, probably best known for being the guy in charge of maintaining Star Fox EX, for being the lead developer of Star Fox CD, and for otherwise making dumb space furry game hacks. I've been ROMhacking for about 5 years now.  
I am not a binary hacker; I need a good disassembly/decompilation or source code to do any work.  

I frequently collaborate with [Kandowontu](https://github.com/kandowontu), and he otherwise usually drags me into his projects to compile something for him or posts about me on his Twitter, which may be how you know I exist, lol.  

I am proficient in the 65816 assembly language (and some Super FX assembly), if that isn't obvious from the nonsense I usually make.  
I have some C knowledge (trying to learn more), and I also know some JavaScript, Batch and Makefile language, along with a very tiny amount of Python. I pretty much know at least something about any language i've encountered or needed to use in my work.
